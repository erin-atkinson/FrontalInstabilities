# CREATE Module: Modelling instabilities at a submesoscale front using Oceananigans
This is a module designed for the NSERC CREATE grant _Training for novel directions in quantitative climate science_. 

Begin by reading `notes/0-introduction.md` for an explanation and outline of the content of the module. Partially completed simulation, plotting and analysis scripts are in `src`. Exercises throughout the module instruct you to fill these out. Completed scripts are available in `src-complete`.
