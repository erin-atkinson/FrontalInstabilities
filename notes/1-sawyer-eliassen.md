# The equations of motion 
This section will outline the derivation of the Boussinesq equations in a rotating frame from the equation of motions of an inviscid, compressible fluid,
$$
\frac{\text{D}\vec u}{\text{D}t} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p - g\hat z \quad \text{and}\quad \frac{\text{D} \rho}{\text{D} t} + \rho \nabla \cdot \vec u = 0.
$$
Where $\vec u = (u, v, w)$ is the velocity, $\rho$ is the density, $p$ is pressure and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The coordinate system is such that $z$ is aligned with the vertical (away from the centre of the Earth).
