# Introduction
This is a module designed for the NSERC CREATE grant _Training for novel directions in quantitative climate science_. 

The ocean is awash with important fluid dynamical processes at all spatial and temporal scales. 

In this module we will create a simulation of flow around a submesoscale ocean front using Oceananigans, a Julia package for finite-difference simulations of the Boussinesq equations, intended for an oceanic context.

The module will assume basic familiarity with fluid dynamics fundamentals and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Proficiency in Julia is not required and should be intuitive for those with experience in Python (numpy) or MATLAB. An outline of this module is as follows:

- Julia setup for Oceananigans and GLMakie (plotting software)
- Derivation of the Boussinesq equations and subsequently the Sawyer-Eliassen equations for the flow in the frontal plane
- Instabilities in the Sawyer-Eliassen equations
- Setting up a simulation
- Visualization
- Analysis and post-processing
